The picluster repository will have the necessary files for the ansible-backed raspberry pi beowulf cluster project.

#### File structure of the repository

###### `/ip/`
Contains the generated IP (individual) files for all nodes (including master).

###### `README.md`
This file you are reading, contains all relevant information about the project.

###### `ip2file.sh`
Saves the current IP of `eth0` to the `/ip/<eth0-MAC-ADDRESS>` file, and overrides it, if exists.

###### `up2git.sh`
Pushes to git the new IP that has been generated by `ip2file.sh`.

###### `/local-vars/`
Directory that will contain all the variables for the individual deployment each time. For example the MAC address of the master node, the public SSH key that the master will use, etc.

###### `/master`
File which will contain the MAC Address of the designated master node.
On fresh repositories this file will not exist, but will generated from the first node that saves its IP in `/ip/` directory. If the file exists (either because the Pi is not the first to boot and add its IP or because the user has added the file manually) it will not be touched.
