The picluster repository will have the necessary files for the ansible-backed raspberry pi beowulf cluster project.

#### File structure of the repository

###### `/ip/`
Contains the generated IP (individual) files for all nodes (including master).

###### `README.md`
This file you are reading, contains all relevant information about the project.

###### `ip2file.sh`
Saves the current IP of `eth0` to the `/ip/<eth0-MAC-ADDRESS>` file, and overrides it, if exists.

###### `up2git.sh`
Pushes to git the new IP that has been generated by `ip2file.sh`.

###### `/local-vars/`
Directory that will contain all the variables for the individual deployment each time. For example the MAC address of the master node, the public SSH key that the master will use, etc.
